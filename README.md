Welcome to [mod.io](https://mod.io) GameMaker Studio 2 Example Extension [created by YellowAfterlife](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/modio-rest). It allows game developers to control the browsing and installation of mod files in their games. It uses a [Haxe wrapper](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/modio-rest) connected to the [mod.io API](https://docs.mod.io), that currently supports GML/sys.threaded/js to make implementation easier. We have a [test environment](https://test.mod.io) available which offers developers a private sandbox to try the GameMaker 2 Plugin out.

## Demonstration
The demonstration file in this repository has small demos of getting user subscriptions/uploading mods/downloading mods. It is a very basic example and you will need to do additional work to get it running in your game.

It was originally made to power custom level support in [Doodle Derby](https://doodlederby.mod.io) for Steam and Nintendo Switch.
